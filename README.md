# Professional TypeScript

**Forked from [github.com/mike-north/professional-ts](https://github.com/mike-north/professional-ts)**

This repo contains completed exercises from Mike North's [Production grade TypeScript](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/production-typescript/) course. The original repo dependencies are quite outdated so some compatibility have been encountered. See [raised issues here](https://github.com/mike-north/professional-ts/issues?q=is:issue+author:johnhunter)

## What's this course about?

This course is intended to help those already somewhat familiar with TypeScript as a programming language, to the point where they're more ready to use it in a real situation with real stakes. Mike shares some of the experience he's had as LinkedIn's TypeScript infrastructure lead, so you don't have to learn things "the hard way" like he did.
